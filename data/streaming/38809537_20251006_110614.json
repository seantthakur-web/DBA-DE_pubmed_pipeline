          "The Sentinel Node Oriented Tailored Approach (SENORITA) randomized clinical trial evaluated quality of life (QoL) and nutritional outcomes between the laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery (LSNNS) and laparoscopic standard gastrectomy (LSG). However, there has been no report on the QoL and nutritional outcomes of patients who underwent stomach-preserving surgery among the LSNNS group.",
          "To compare long-term QoL and nutritional outcomes between patients who underwent stomach-preserving surgery and those who underwent standard gastrectomy and to identify factors associated with poor QoL outcomes in patients who underwent stomach-preserving surgery.",
          "This study is a secondary analysis of the SENORITA trial, a randomized clinical trial comparing LSNNS with LSG. Patients from 7 tertiary or general hospitals across the Republic of Korea were enrolled from March 2013 to December 2016, with follow-up through 5 years. Data were analyzed between August and September 2022. Among trial participants, patients who underwent actual laparoscopic standard gastrectomy in the LSG group and those who underwent stomach-preserving surgery in the LSNNS group were included. Patients who did not complete the baseline or any follow-up questionnaire were excluded.",

          "A total of 194 and 257 patients who underwent stomach-preserving surgery and standard gastrectomy, respectively, were included in this study (mean [SD] age, 55.6 [10.6] years; 249 [55.2%] male). The stomach-preserving group had better QoL scores at 3 months postoperatively in terms of physical function (87.2 vs 83.9), dyspnea (5.9 vs 11.2), appetite loss (13.1 vs 19.4), dysphagia (8.0 vs 12.7), eating restriction (10.9 vs 18.2), anxiety (29.0 vs 35.2), taste change (7.4 vs 13.0), and body image (19.5 vs 27.2). At 1 year postoperatively, the stomach-preserving group had significantly higher body mass index (23.9 vs 22.1, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and hemoglobin (14.3 vs 13.3 g/dL), albumin (4.3 vs 4.25 g/dL), and protein (7.3 vs 7.1 g/dL) levels compared to the standard group. Multivariable analyses showed that tumor location (greater curvature, lower third) was favorably associated with global health status (\u03b2, 10.5; 95% CI, 3.2 to 17.8), reflux (\u03b2, -8.4; 95% CI, -14.7 to -2.1), and eating restriction (\u03b2, -5.7; 95% CI, -10.3 to -1.0) at 3 months postoperatively in the stomach-preserving group. Segmental resection was associated with risk of diarrhea (\u03b2, 40.6; 95% CI, 3.1 to 78.1) and eating restriction (\u03b2, 15.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 29.1) at 3 years postoperatively.",
